# react-rollup-todos

> Tiny React app that uses the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to display some todo data.

This is a small repo I used to experiment with the various configuration options and plugins available in Rollup, and comparing it to my past experience using Webpack. The app in this repo is transpiled using Babel, supports CSS modules, and is using livereload for development purposes.

## setup

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:rayzr522/react-rollup-todos.git
cd react-rollup-todos

# install dependencies
npm ci

# run the dev server
npm run dev
```
